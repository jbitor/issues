=====

Some tasks:

[ x ] Bencoding from specific data structure
[ x ] Bencoding tests
[ x ] Bencodable interface with tests
[ x ] Check err every time you .() coerce values
[ x ] Use "marshalling" naming conventions like json
[ x ] Use []byte IO instead of strings
[ x ] Torrent metadata struct
[ x ] Torrent metadata to bencoding
[ x ] Torrent metadata to bencoding tests
[   ] - including tests for multiple-piece torrents
[   ] - including tests for failures, and sanity assertions
[   ] consider defining custom types for bval.values.
[   ] Torrent metadata from bencoding
[   ] Support JSON marshalling of bencoding.Value
[   ] JSON marshalling support for torrent metadata through bencoding
[   ] More explicit tests using interfaces
[   ] Bdecoding to specific data structure
[   ] Bdecoding tests
[   ] Bdecodable interface with tests
[   ] ./distributed bencode_json < x.torrent.json > x.torrent
[   ] ./distributed bdecode_json < x.torrent > x.torrent.json
[   ] ./distributed torrent info < x.torrrent
[   ] Torrent metadata generation
[   ] Torrent metadata verification
[   ] ./distributed torrent verify ROOT < x.torrrent
[   ] Make bencoding source of truth for torrent info, so that you can preserve the hash.

[   ] Implement a DHT peer
[   ] Implement BitTorrent peer who can join swarm - no downloading yet
[   ] Implement extension protocol for BitTorrent peer
[   ] Implement metadata download from swarm (BEP-9)
[   ] Implement BitTorrent downloading
[   ] Implement Message Stream Encryption/obfuscation for BitTorrent peer
[   ] Consider Fast Extension (BEP-6)
[   ] Consider HTTP seeding per BEP-17 and BEP-19
[   ] Support partial seeds per BEP-21
