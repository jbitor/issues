Consider copying implementation details from libtorrent or libtransmission or
baretorrent. You could potentially include their copyright notice, since the
licenses  are compatible, and then copy implementation details freely.

Or potentially create wrappers using the Client() interface or something
wrapping these other torrent libraries, so that any of them could be
plugged in to the frontends. (That would warrant the name `gotorrent`.
